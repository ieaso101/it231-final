                <h2>Inbound 2019</h2>
                <p>Inbound is one of the largest sales and marketing conferences in the world (hosted by HubSpot, 
                    a billion dollar marketing software and industry leader in the space), with tens of thousands of professionals
                    gather together from around the globe to network, learn, and celebrate marketing. In 2019, Solomon Thimothy 
                    (CEO of OneIMS) was invited to walk the show floor and interview remarkable guests and companies at the event.
                </p>
                <p>The videos that were shot for the Inbound conference were much more "run and gun," consisting of only one camera and
                        a shotgun microphone. There is very little prep and interviews are done spontaneouslyâ€“ typically through a 5 minute
                        or less conversation. Shoots like these have very quick turnaround times, with the ability to go live and published
                        within 24 hours.
                </p>

                <h2>Novus Navigator</h2>
                <p>Novus Navigator is an interview series produced by Novus Club, a non-profit that promotes technology 
                    & entrepreneurship skills to high school students. In this series, the founders of the organization 
                    speak to entrepreneurs and business leaders to allow students to hear the different backgrounds and 
                    success stories.
                </p>
                <p>These shoots are still done professionally, but are much more casually shot. A typical Novus Navigator
                        consists of two cameras and either a shotgun microphone or a single lavalier microphone. Natural or available
                        lighting is used as well. These conversations can last anywhere from 20-30 minutes, but have a turn around time of
                        less than 1 weeks since there is less footage to work with.
